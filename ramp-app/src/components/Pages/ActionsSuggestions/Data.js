    'Opt at eliminating the risk, for example by seeking technical solutions or changed work technique. If this is not doable, due to technical, organisational, financial or suchlike reasons, work with reducing the risk, preferably to low risk (“green”) level. Different types of actions are likely needed to reduce the risk and successful improvements mostly involve work in several areas. Creativity and openness for change and new ideas are often required to derive at good solutions. Some changes can lead to effects after a short time, others can lead to effects in a long time perspective. The injury risk is affected by the load (such as exerted force, force direction, and posture) and time aspects (such as duration, recovery time, and frequency). Avoid transferring a risk from one employee to another and try to avoid introducing new risks when changes are introduced. New solutions should also be assessed from a risk perspective.',
    descriptionTwo: 'Changes are context dependent, which can be described consisting of different parts: Economic context (e.g. economic cycle); Regulatory context (e.g. depending on which country the company is operating in); Sectorial context (e.g. technology level, competition situation and profit margins in the sector); Societal context (e.g. culture, standards and practice in the society the company is active in); and Company context (e.g. culture, standards and practice within the company).',
    descriptionThree: 'RAMPs Action model (see the sheet “Action model”) gives an overview of how changes can be achieved at the company within the five areas Technology & Design, Organisation, Employees, Environment, and Vision and Strategies. It is suggested to work, preferably in hierarchical order, within each of the five areas.  Here below, examples of action suggestions, which could be applicable in the specific situation to reduce the risk assessed in RAMP II, are given. ',
