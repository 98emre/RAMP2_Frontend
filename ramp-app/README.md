# RAMP2 Frontend
We have developed a web application that processes an XML file containing instructions for RAMP 2, which is an assessment tool designed for a detailed analysis and evaluation of ergonomic risk factors related to manual material handling tasks. These tasks can increase the risk of musculoskeletal disorders. Manual material handling includes activities such as lifting, pushing, or pulling objects manually. Prolonged or frequent exposure to these risk factors can increase the likelihood of developing or exacerbating musculoskeletal disorders.

This our web appliction where we used React with Redux and hooks for frontend.

## Frontend Technology Stack

Our web application is built using React, utilizing Redux for state management and leveraging hooks for an optimized user interface.

## Getting Started

This project was initialized with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

Before diving into development, make sure you have npm installed.

### Installation

In the project directory, run:

This will install all the necessary dependencies.

### Development Mode

To start the application in development mode, run:

This will launch the app, and you can access it in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The page will automatically reload whenever you make changes, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### Running Tests

To execute tests in interactive watch mode, use:


For more information on running tests, refer to the [testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### Building for Production

To build the application for production and generate optimized assets in the `build` folder, use:


This process minifies the code and includes unique hashes in filenames for optimal performance. Your app will be ready for deployment.

For detailed deployment instructions, please refer to the [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### Ejecting

**Note: Ejecting is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

If you find yourself dissatisfied with the build tool and configuration choices provided by Create React App, you can choose to eject at any time. Ejecting copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (such as webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, granting you full control over them. 
While all commands except `eject` will still work, they will now point to the copied scripts for customization. However, it's essential to consider that the curated feature set is well-suited for small to mid-sized deployments, 
and you may not need to eject unless you require extensive customization.

## Learn More

To delve deeper into React and its usage, explore the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/). Additionally, you can refer to the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) for more information on this project's structure and advanced configurations.

For topics such as code splitting, analyzing bundle size, creating progressive web apps, advanced configurations, and troubleshooting, please check the corresponding sections in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs).

Should you encounter issues related to minification during the build process, consult the troubleshooting section on [minification](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify).

We hope you find this documentation helpful in developing and maintaining the RAMP2 Frontend. If you have any further questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to our team.
