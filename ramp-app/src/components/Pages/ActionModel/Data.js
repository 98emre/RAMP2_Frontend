    "likley needed to reduce the risk and successful improvements mostly involve work in serveral areas. Table 1 below (Based on the RAMP Action model, OSHAS 18001:2007, " +
    "and the Swedish Work Enviroment Act) gives examples of actions at a more detailed level than the Action model Figure. Work, preferably in hierarchical order, within each of the" +
    "five areas. Creativity and openness for change and new ideas are often required to derive at good solutions. Some changes can lead to effects after a short time, others can" +
    "lead to effects in a long time perspective. The injury risk is affected by the load(such as exerted force, force direction, and posture) amd time aspects (such as duration, recovery" +
    "time, and frequency). Avoid transferring a risk from one emplyee to another and try to avoid introducing new risks when changes are introduced. New solutions should alse be assessed from a risk perspective.",
